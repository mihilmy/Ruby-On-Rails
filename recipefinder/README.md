## Recipe Finder

The overall goal was to implement a Rails application using model,
view, and controller classes.

  * the model class will access information
  * the view class will display information and accept commands from the user
  * the controller class will implement actions through internal service logic
    and the delegation to model and view classes.

The functional goal is to provide web page access to recipe information
served by `http://food2fork.com/api` through JSON and images. Documentation for the 
API can be found at http://food2fork.com/about/api.
